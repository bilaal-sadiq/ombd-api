# ombd-API
This is my OMBD API application, where I can look at past and present Movies/TV shows. 

Tech StackðŸ“¦: I used Vanilla JavaScript and CSS to build my application while hitting real APIs. 

ProcessðŸ’­: After building a Weather app and Pokeman image app, I thought it was best to test my API skills even more by creating a movie app where you can search for your favourite movies/shows. It was quite a challenge, and I spent more time than I needed to on this project. One key element I've learned while building this project is that I need to be more prepared and accept that my code won't work the first time every time. 

LearningsðŸ“š & ImprovementsðŸ› : I learned how to return an error if there is an HTTP or API response issue. In the future, I would approach this project very differently. I spent too much time worrying about displaying the six movie cards and ended up creating six movie cards in my HTML. This was bad practice on my part and made my code look messy. This is where I learned about "Slice()" and could return precisely six movie cards without extra HTML.
