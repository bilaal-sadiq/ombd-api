# ombd-API
This is my OMDb API-based application, designed to enable users to browse and search for both past and current films and television shows.

Tech StackðŸ“¦: The application was developed using Vanilla JavaScript and CSS, with real-time data fetched from the OMDb (Open Movie Database) API.

Development ProcessðŸ’­: After completing prior API-integrated projects such as a weather dashboard and a PokÃ©mon image viewer, I challenged myself to deepen my understanding of API consumption by building a fully functional movie search tool. This project tested my ability to manage asynchronous data flow, handle user input dynamically, and render API responses efficiently. While I initially underestimated the scope and time investment, the experience proved invaluable in refining my problem-solving and planning skills. A key takeaway was learning to embrace iterative debugging and accept that code seldom works as expected on the first attempt.

Key Learnings ðŸ“š & Areas for ImprovementðŸ› : One of the most important lessons I took from this project was the implementation of error handling for API and HTTP response failures, which significantly improved the application's resilience and user experience. On reflection, I recognised that my original method of statically generating six HTML movie cards was inefficient and poor practice. This led me to explore array manipulation techniques, such as the slice() method, allowing me to dynamically render exactly six movie cards based on API response data, eliminating unnecessary static markup and improving maintainability.
